Sorts And Trees
================

#Description:  
This progject contains array sorting algorithms ,functions to create, traverse and balance trees, search algorithms, graphs, and hashtables. There is also a random Atoi function because I wanted to know how to implement that function.

##Purpose:  
This is a collection of data structures and algorithms that I created/collated using online resources. I did this to gain a better understanding of data structures and algorithms.

##Classes  
 *  bNode  
  * bNodes hold the data for the trees and are used to build the tree structures.
  * bNodes have functions to get the next items in the tree.  
 * bTree 
  * The bTree class is a binary tree class.  
 * AVLTree 
  *  AVLTree is my AVL Tree class
  *  AVLTree is self balancing.  
 * Sorts 
  * The sorting algorithms included are:  
    * Quick Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Top-Down Merge Sort
    * Bottom-Up Merge Sort

##Sources:
The code in this project is for practice only. Much of the code is based on online sources, the list of which is still being compiled.
Some of these are:
