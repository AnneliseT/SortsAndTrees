Sorts And Trees
================

#Description:  
This progject contains array sorting algorithms and functions to create, traverse and balance trees.

##Purpose:  
The purpose of this project was to create a set of the common sorting algorithms and to brush up on my tree building knowledge.

##Classes  
 *  bNode  
  * bNodes hold the data for the trees and are used to build the tree structures.
  * bNodes have functions to get the next items in the tree.  
 * bTree 
  * The bTree class is a binary tree class.  
 * AVLTree 
  *  AVLTree is my AVL Tree class
  *  AVLTree is self balancing.  
 * Sorts 
  * The sorting algorithms included are:  
    * Quick Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Top-Down Merge Sort
    * Bottom-Up Merge Sort
